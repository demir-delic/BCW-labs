### Tips
* Refer to the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp" target="_blank">Function Reference</a> if necessary.
* Create all functions in the app.js file.

### Tasks
* Create a function named `square` that receives one number parameter and returns the square of that parameter.
* Create a function named `add` that receives two number parameters and returns the sum of both parameters.
* Create a function named `difference` that receives two number parameters and returns the result of subtracting the smaller number from the larger number. Make sure the function determines which parameter is larger before calculating the difference.
* Create a function named `formula` that receives three number parameters and returns the result of the following process:
    * Step 1: call your `square` function with the first parameter and store the rseult in a variable.
    * Step 2: call your `add` function with the second and third parameters and store the result in a variable.
    * Step 3: call your `difference` function with the results of Step 1 and Step 2 and return the result.
* Create a function named `total` with no parameters, but uses the `arguments` object to return the sum of any provided arguments.
* Create a function named `fullName` that receives two string parameters and returns the values concatenated with a space between them.
* Create a function named `longestName` that receives three string parameters and returns the result of the following process:
    * Step 1: call your `fullName` function with the first and second parameters and store the result in a variable.
    * Step 2: call your `fullName` function with the second and third parameters and store the result in a variable.
    * Step 3: call your `fullName` function with the first and third parameters and store the result in a variable.
    * Step 4: return the longest of the three results.
